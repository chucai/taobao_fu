Intro
======

TaobaoFu is a Rails plugin as an unofficial Ruby SDK for the Taobao Open Platform.


Dependencies
=======

Currently, this TOP-SDK dependents on several plugins/gems. Before you run the plugin, you need to install them first.

  >> ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/adamwiggins/rest-client.git # for the development environment.
  >> ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/jnunemaker/crack.git
  
If you are using git with your Rails project, maybe you need to install them as git submodules:

  >> git submodule add git://github.com/adamwiggins/rest-client.git vendor/plugins/rest-client
  >> git submodule add git://github.com/jnunemaker/crack.git vendor/plugins/crack
  >> git submodule init
  >> git submodule update
  
Recommend you use gem Patron instead of the rest-client if your Rails app is runing on a Unix/Linux/MacOSX machine. Patron is a more powerful and stable Ruby HTTP client based on libcurl. For more details about Patron, see http://github.com/toland/patron .

  >> sudo gem install patron
  
After installed patron, you need to modify the config/taobao.yml file, ensure the :enable_curl option is true(default is false in the development environment).


Install
=======

Well, assuming you have already installed rest-client(or Patron) and Crack, It's time to install our plugin.

  >> ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/404/taobao_fu.git
  >> ruby script/generate taobao # This command will create a TOP configuration file named taobao.yml under the config/ directory.

It's the same as the previous operation that you can install it as a git submodule.


Usage
=======

You need to configure config/taobao.yml first.

There are four methods mapping HTTP GET/POST/PUT/DELETE verbs.

Taobao.get #(Available)
Taobao.post
Taobao.update
Taobao.delete


Example
=======

This example used a real TOP account and ran under the production environment, so it can access the online database of taobao.com. See config/taobao.yml for more details.

  > cd your_rails_app
  > ruby script/console
  >> Taobao.get(:method => 'taobao.item.get',
                :nick   => 'simul官方旗舰店',
                :iid    => '3b54462a34e2ed84c330dc3e5fb4a94f', 
                :fields => 'title, price')


Future
=======

Add more and more methods, like Taobao::Item.get, etc.
Full Chinese documentation support.
